# WELCOME TO THE ART OF LIFE GITHUB PAGE !

Art of Life is an artistic project developped at the Institute for Future Technologies by the Human Learning innovation group. \
This project aims to be a platform for artistic creations based on human physiological signals, may it be for pure entertainment or other purposes such as relaxation.
The basis of the project relies on the use of multiple sensors, such as an Electrocardiogram, monitoring the heart signal of the user, or an Electrodermal Activity Sensor, monitoring the user's skin conductance. The data recovered from the sensors is processed and sent through multiple softwares to output music and visuals.
