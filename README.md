# WELCOME TO THE ART OF LIFE GITHUB PAGE !

Art of Life is an artistic project developped at the Institute for Future Technologies by the Human Learning innovation group. \
This project aims to be a platform for artistic creations based on human physiological signals, may it be for pure entertainment or other purposes such as relaxation.
The basis of the project relies on the use of multiple sensors, such as an Electrocardiogram, monitoring the heart signal of the user, or an Electrodermal Activity Sensor, monitoring the user's skin conductance. The data recovered from the sensors is processed and sent through multiple softwares to output music and visuals.
\
\
The vision of this project was created in the idea of creating art generated from everyone's deep interior, taking inspiration at interactive works such as I AM (Eleni Stavrakidou) or The Ethereal Phenomena (Silvana Malaver, et al.). The inspiration for the output was inspired by the visual works of Luncinda Dilly and Light Mapping shows such as the Aura Invalides. The music output was inspired by the Youtube channel Space Ambient.

On this page, you can find the different filed used through Visual Studio Code, FL Studio 20 and MadMapper 5.0.7 in this project. You can also find the documentation related to the project called "HowTo_ArtOfLife.md".\
With those, you should be able to recreate the project on your own. If not, don't hesitate to contact me at pauleven95@gmail.com
